Used for string manipulation.
These are Domain Specific Language (DSL)

Uses:
-> Verifying that strings match a pattern (e.g. the string has a format of an email address).
-> Perform substitutions in a string.

DSL: Are highly specialized mini programming languages.
Regular ezpressions are popular example, and SQL is another.
Private domain-specific languages are often used for specific industrial purposes.


For Python:
Can be accessed in Pyhton using the re module, which is the part of the standard library.

After regular expression is defined, re.match function can be used to determine whether it matches at the beginning of a string.
If it does not, match returns an object representing the match, if not, it returns None.

To avoid any consfusion while working with regular expressions, we would use raw strings as r"expression".
Raw strings doesn't escape anything, which makes use of regular expressions easier.
